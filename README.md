# VidEX ðŸŽ¬ 
VidEX is a simple video recognition app designed to identify movies based on short video clips. Just like Shazam recognizes songs, VidEX enables users to capture a 10-second video clip, which is then analyzed against a database of movies. If a match is found, the app provides details about the identified movie.  

## Features  
- Capture or upload a short video clip  
- Scan and match against a movie database  
- Get movie details instantly  
- Fast and efficient recognition  

## Status  
The front-end of VidEX is fully developed, and backend integration will be completed soon.
